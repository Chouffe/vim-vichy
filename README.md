Vim-Vichy
==========

Vim-Vichy is the vim plugin enabling collaborative editing within Vim.
The keystroke '-' triggers a blame of the current edited buffer while syncing
with the server.

Installation
==========

I recommend installing pathogen.vim and then simply copy and paste into your
bundle folder:

> git clone git://github.com/Chouffe/vim-vichy.git
